constant migrane. I can feel the headache every second for over four years

has severe memory problem, especially working memory and memory associated with spatial locating. 

MRI has a T2 high signal in the parietal cortex. only a white spot, doctor said it 

In my view, feel some stuff stuck in the parietal cortex which block the memory circuits and cause migrane (maybe nociceptors near dura mater or vessel).
