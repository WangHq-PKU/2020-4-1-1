Analyze the growth of new cases to explain the pandemic trend

Modeling the pandemic with exponential and logistic model

Function f: Day t -> confirmed cases ℕ
Compute new cases: f(t+1) – f(t), 

(f(t+1)-f(t))-(f(t)-f(t-1))

Can be used to see when the growth stabilize, when growth drops. (i.e. fewer new cases than previous day)

•	Modeling the pandemic with exponential and logistic model.

For simulation function f(x), compute ∑▒〖(𝑦_𝑖−𝑓(𝑥_𝑖))〗^2/(∑▒〖(𝑦_𝑖−𝑦 ̅)〗^2 ), if < 0.05, fit, otherwise don't fit. (we wish ∑▒〖(𝑦_𝑖−𝑓(𝑥_𝑖))〗^2  equal 0)

•	compute the variation of different time span to analyze the pandemic trend.

How many days it takes to double the cases.

New cases and derivative are local property. Yet time of doubling the cases can manifest features of a longer time scale(ex: 7 days).

We can see when efforts are taken to block the transmission, the time cost of doubling increases. (Italy: 3 days -> 7 days)

If no serious efforts are taken, the cases would double every 5-7 days . 

Changes of confirmed cases every n days.

calculate f(x+n) – f(x).

We choose n= 5, 7.

We can clearly observe that all curves of new cases are going through a period of acceleration-stabilize-drop

From variation of new cases, we can clearly see that pandemic in Italy starts to drop, in Spain stabilize. Yet in US and France it is still growing.

For Italy, Spain and China, exponential curve don't fit. logistic curve fit.

For US, France, exponential curve and logistic curve both fit.

log(2)/(log(as.numeric(df_Italy[1, i])/(temp_1)))*temp_3

We can observe that week growth of Italy and Spain starts to drop, yet week growth of US and France still increase.
